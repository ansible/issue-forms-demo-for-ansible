      **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for ansible-core!**



      üí°
      Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it
      would be useful for majority of the ansible-core users. As a
      general rule of thumb, any feature that is only of interest to a
      small sub group should be [implemented in a third-party Ansible
      Collection][contribute to collections] or maybe even just your
      project alone. Be mindful of the fact that the essential
      ansible-core features have a broad impact.

      If unsure, consider filing a [new proposal] instead outlining your
      use-cases, the research and implementation considerations. Then,
      start a discussion on one of the public [IRC meetings] we have just
      for this.

      Verify first that your idea is not [already requested on
      GitHub][issue search].

      Also test if the devel branch does not already implement this.

      *Complete **all** sections as described, this form is processed
      automatically.*


      **Tip:** If you are seeking community support, please consider
      [starting a mailing list thread or chatting in IRC][ML||IRC].


      Thank you for your collaboration!

      Describe the new feature/improvement you would like briefly below.


      What's the problem this feature will solve?

      What are you trying to do, that you are unable to achieve
      with ansible-core as it currently stands?


      Provide examples of real world use cases that this would enable
      and how it solves the problem you described. How do you solve this
      now? Have you tried to workaround the problem using other tools? Or
      a different approach to solving this issue?


      *Know **exactly** what you want?* Consider filing a [new proposal]
      instead outlining your research and implementation considerations.

      I am trying to do X with ansible-core from the devel branch on GitHub and
      I think that implementing a feature Y would be very helpful for me and
      every other user of ansible-core because of Z.
